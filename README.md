# uploading-data-from-file-to-MySql-in-Java
Here I have created a db the structure to which the data has to be uploaded has also been shared by the name acct_doc_header.sql.  There's a pojo class to manage all the attributes. Finally the class JavaLoadData manages and handles all the data that has to be loaded from the csv and upload into the DB.


MySql connector is needed to use jdbc
I've also attached the connector that I used for the execution.

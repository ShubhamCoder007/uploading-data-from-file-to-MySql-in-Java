# uploading-data-from-file-to-MySql-in-Java
Here I have created a db the structure to which the data has to be uploaded has also been shared by the name acct_doc_header.sql.  There's a pojo class to manage all the attributes. Finally the class JavaLoadData manages and handles all the data that has to be loaded from the csv and upload into the DB.
